/**
 * Programming Practice

 Imagine that you are developing a software package that requires users to enter their own
 passwords. Your software requires that users’ passwords meet the following criteria:
  The password should be at least six characters long.
  The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter.
  The password should have at least one digit and one special character. (A special
 character is not alphabetic and is not a digit).
  The password should not be in the array of not allowed passwords. For testing purposes, do
 not allow passwords to be one of the following strings: "Password1","Mypassw0rd".

 Ask for the user name and password. Keep asking for a password until the user enters a password
 that meets the criteria above.

 Output the username and the password. Then, output the user and the hidden password “******”.
 Add JavaDoc comments to this program.

 Bonus 5 points: Encrypt the password as follows:
  Replace each character with the ASCII character that follows it. (If the character is ‘a’,
 replace it with ‘b’.)
  Reverse the entire password.

 Output the username and original password and output the username and its encrypted version.
